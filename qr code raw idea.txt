qr code idea:

1.) when nowires.com is fetched, then a random string(x) is generated and a document with the name x is created.
2.) Based on this x, we create a qrcode. 
3.) When a phone scans that code, it receives that x value and using x as document name, it inserts
    the required ftp: url in the document.
4.) Once there is value in the document, the webpage automatically opens the url present in the
    document.
5.) After session is closed, the document should be deleted.
